# Example 1 - Bootstrap Azure, Convert to AWS

In this example I created the Azure terraform first. The fictitious project was for a managed kubernetes cluster with access to a container registry and only internal networking allowed. It also called for having the ability to use a network load balancer for workloads (for ingress).

>**NOTE** It added the Makefile without my prompting for it. Nifty!
