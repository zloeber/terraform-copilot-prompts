# Example 1 - Bootstrap AWS, Convert to Azure

In this example I created the AWS terraform first with the `/terraform-aws-bootstrap` agent prompt. The fictitious project was for a crazy large Wordpress development environment running on virtual machines with some specific disk requirements and access to a cloud file store. 

I then converted the generated AWS deployment into Azure with the `/terraform-aws-to-azure` agent prompt.

>**NOTE** It added the cost comparison documentation into the document without my asking for it directly.
